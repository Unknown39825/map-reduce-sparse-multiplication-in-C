# map-reduce-sparse-multiplication-in-C
this is the basic implementation for the sparse multiplication using map reduce.

# the sparsein function
it takes input in sparse form

# the get function
it is  the basic function to create and input the matrix in normal form;



# the combine function 
it is used to combining the matrix in mapreducible form
firstly it makes seperate file for the the matrix one and two named as file1.txt and file2.txt and then combine them in D.txt

# the map function
it takes the input from the D.txt and makes key value pairs and put it in 



# the reduce function 
it takes input from the Dpart.txt and firstly sort them
and takes input one by one if same key occurs then it will add product of 
arr 1 and arr2 into result else
makes new terms
finally all result is written to result.txt 
in the form of row ,col ,value pair.

# fileto sparse function
it is used to take input from the result file;

# disp function 
it is used to display result in normal form;

# spdisp function

it is used to display result in sparse form;

currently 40 x 40 is supported we can change size in the preprecessor 
and maximum it can handle 800 input per matrix if size increase time incresase so better sorting tecnique may be used.
